This is a simple Chrome extension to replace a handful of phrases that really grind my gears while browsing.

# Replacements

- "All of the sudden" -> "All of a sudden"
- "On accident" -> "By accident"
- "legos" -> "LEGO"

# Features

- With the exception of "LEGO" which is always capitalized case is maintained so "All Of The Sudden" becomes "All Of A Sudden" and "all of the sudden" becomes "all of the sudden."
- There is an options page where you can disable any of the three replacements and toggle whether to underline replaced instances.
